## What part of the code was most confusing and why?
I still don't understand the 500 in the bottom is it 5 seconds or 500ms because I am unsure of what it really does. 
## How does the animation help visualize asynchronous behavior?
It helps by showing us that even though it reads the whole code it is still able to have animations have their own time to playout which I found interesting and easily digestable in this manner. 
## What did you change or improve, and what effect did it have?
I added the "Jeopardy Theme" sound effect. I think it enhanced the wait time. It adds a delay and the loading screen feels longer.
